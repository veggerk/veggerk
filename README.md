I study freshwater and marine habitats. My research focuses primarily on two topics: stable isotopes to study predator-prey dynamics, and otoliths to study past growth rates of fish. I frequently collaborate with colleagues at NOAA and University of Washington School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences on a diverse array of topics and projects ranging from high altitude spawning streams in Idaho, to oyster farms in the Puget Sound, WA.
